<h1>
Final Project Scenario
</h1>
<h4>
Estimated duration: 5 minutes
</h4>
<h2 id="scenario">Scenario</h2>
<p>Neuro Ability Development (NAD) Inc. specializes in developing a wide
line of healthcare products. NAD Inc. has fallen behind the competition
in terms of timely product launches. The CEO met with the Marketing
Director and requested the marketing team adopt Scrum for certain
projects based on the following analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li>
The healthcare industry is highly competitive. Often, new product ideas
and opportunities arise that did not exist during the initial planning
phase. Current traditional project methods are slow to react to these
opportunities, and the company often lags far behind its competitors.
The outcome is a loss of customers and revenue. NAD Inc. has a strong
team of skilled and competent traditional project managers. However,
none have Scrum experience.
</li>
</p>
<li>
Various stakeholders, particularly the sales team, need immediate
marketing support. They believe their requirements are the top priority.
Traditional project management methods frustrate stakeholders and often
overwhelm the marketing team. None of the sales and marketing teams are
familiar with Scrum. However, they are open to adopting the new
methodology to improve their situation.
</li>
</p>
<li>
Other teams blame the marketing team for being the corporate bottleneck
impacting sales and growth. The sales team believes that marketing is
slow to react to a rapidly changing environment and often forces product
deliveries that are too late or do not work within the targeted
segments. The good news is that NAD Inc. has a collocated area shared by
marketing, sales, and IT. Employees do not need to go far to
collaborate.
</li>
</p>
<li>
Marketing has numerous customers. Communications and collaboration are
fragmented. Work often slows down by a failure to gain the right inputs,
review new product ideas or needs, and gain required signoffs.
Stakeholders waste time as they can't determine who they need to
approach for the decisions that they need to make. NAD Inc. missed
numerous opportunities to partner with large retailers to feature their
product line. The company's product line is outstanding. Unfortunately,
they generally lose their first-mover advantage due to their inefficient
product rollout methods.
</li>
</p>
<li>
The amount of data that you need to process outpaces marketing's ability
to analyze the data and make timely decisions. The IT team stated they
have adequate technology and skilled personnel to upgrade services and
applications. Unfortunately, NAD Inc.'s technology improvements often
complete after the competition has brought out similar upgrades. In
addition, the number of change requests received during implementation
caused further delays, confusion, and technical debt.
</li>
</p>
<li>
The Marketing Director agrees that there are pressures from every side,
the team is slow to react, and a more agile approach is needed. The
marketing team must deal with an environment where information cycles
are changing rapidly, the way people consume information is dynamic, and
to stay competitive, the firm must be able to deliver faster and more
frequently. The team understands its customer base and its needs. They
need to improve the time to market.
</li>
